## Inspiration
I always found myself trying to skim through my material before exams to check if i remember or not,
after introduction of AI models like gemini and chatGPT I began giving the text to the model and asking to generate some random questions. I thought lets automate this process and here it is.

## What it does
My project has basically two functionalities 
1. Generate Quizes based on the field user chose
2. Generate flash cards from the material provided by the user
